```bash
# 1. Run the test suite
cd /home/user/nexus
pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Review helper scripts
cat docs/operations/helper-scripts.md

# 3. Copy one script to Pi (test)
# (You'll need to do this from your actual machine)
```

### THIS WEEK (If interested in improvements):
1. Read: `multi-model-ensemble.md` (30 min)
2. Read: `quality-validator.md` (20 min)
3. Decide: Implement these? (Yes = big quality boost)

### THIS MONTH (If considering business):
1. Read: `monetization-strategy.md` (1 hour)
2. Read: `nexus-2.0-architecture.md` (1 hour)
3. Decide: Hobby project or business venture?

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ **Don't try to implement everything at once** - Pick 1-2 projects
❌ **Don't skip the test suite** - Run it first to verify current code works
❌ **Don't deploy strategic docs to Pi** - They're planning docs, not operational
❌ **Don't feel overwhelmed** - Each doc is standalone, read as needed

---

## 📞 NEED HELP?

**If you want to implement something:**
1. Read the specific guide (they're step-by-step)
2. All code is included (copy-paste ready)
3. Each guide has testing procedures

**If you're confused:**
1. Start with this index (you're here!)
2. Read current ops docs first
3. Strategic docs are optional (for future planning)

---

## 📊 SUMMARY

**What you have:**
- ✅ **Current operational docs** - Use daily (existing)
- ✅ **Strategic planning docs** - Read when scaling (new)
- ✅ **Implementation guides** - Follow to build features (new)
- ✅ **Test suite** - Run to verify code (new, ready to use)
- ✅ **Helper scripts** - Deploy for daily ops (new, ready to use)

**What to do next:**
1. Deploy helper scripts (immediate value)
2. Run test suite (verify everything works)
3. Read strategic docs (when ready to plan future)
4. Implement features one at a time (follow guides)

**Remember:** The strategic/implementation docs are for LATER. Focus on current operations first! 🎯
