# Decision Log - Major Forks in the Road

Every significant decision documented with context, alternatives, and outcomes.

## Format

**Decision:** What we decided
**Date:** When
**Context:** Why this mattered
**Alternatives Considered:** What else we could have done
**Reasoning:** Why we chose this path
**Outcome:** What actually happened (updated later)
**Would We Do It Again?** Retrospective (added later)

## November 2024

### Decision: Start with ChatGPT Research
**Date:** Day 0 (~18 days ago)
**Context:** How do we even begin with faceless content monetization?
**The Spark:** "Strong ChatGPT prompt on how to make faceless content money generation"

**What We Did:**
- Asked ChatGPT for comprehensive strategy
- Got ideas on different approaches
- Started experimenting with structures
- This led to the whole journey

**Why This Worked:**
- Clear goal from day 1 (make money from content)
- Research before building
- Understood the landscape
- Had multiple paths to explore

**Outcome:** ✅ *Led to everything - the foundation of the journey*
**Would We Do It Again?** ✅ *Absolutely - start with research, understand what's possible*

### Decision: Build Infrastructure First, Monetize Later
**Date:** November 2024
**Context:** Could rush to market with manual processes OR build automation first
**Alternatives:**
- Launch immediately with manual carousel creation
- Outsource content creation to freelancers
- Use existing tools (Canva, Buffer, etc.)

**Reasoning:**
- Perfectionism won't let us launch broken things
- Want consistent quality (automation helps)
- Learning compounds - build skills now, go faster later
- Infrastructure makes everything else easier
- Can't scale manual processes

**Outcome:** ⏳ *In progress - carousel automation working, ~18 days so far*
**Would We Do It Again?** ⏳ *TBD - ask me in 6 months*

### Decision: Raspberry Pi Infrastructure (After Cloud Detour)
**Date:** November 2024
**Context:** Need 24/7 system for automation - tried cloud first, came back to local
**The Journey:**
- Started with local PC setup
- Tried cloud VPS
- Got sidetracked on another cloud project
- Finally: Built Nexus (Raspberry Pi)

**Why Pi After Cloud:**
- One-time cost vs recurring cloud bills
- Learn Linux/Docker/networking deeply
- Own the hardware, full control
- Good enough for our scale
- More fun to build

**Outcome:** ✅ *Working! Nexus is stable, runs 24/7*
**Cost:** $150 one-time vs $5-20/month cloud = breaks even in 7-30 months
**Real Learning:** The detours taught us what we actually needed
**Would We Do It Again?** ✅ *Yes - the cloud detour wasn't wasted, it clarified what we wanted*

---

### Decision: AI Stack (Groq + Gemini + Claude)
**Date:** November 2024
**Context:** Need AI for fact generation, content creation, polishing
**Alternatives:**
- OpenAI only (expensive)
- Self-hosted models (complex)
- Manual writing (doesn't scale)

**Reasoning:**
- Groq: Fast + cheap for simple tasks
- Gemini: Creative + image generation
- Claude: Best at polishing
- Use strengths of each
- Cost optimization

**Outcome:** ✅ *Working great*
**Cost:** ~$0.02 per carousel vs $0.50+ with OpenAI only
**Would We Do It Again?** ✅ *Absolutely*

### Decision: Instagram Carousel First (Sequential Platform Launch)
**Date:** November 2024
**Context:** Which platform to launch on first?
**Alternatives:**
- YouTube (higher revenue potential, but video is harder)
- TikTok (easier to go viral, but need video too)
- All at once (spread thin, nothing done well)

**Reasoning:**
- Carousels easier than video for first automation
- Instagram has good engagement for educational/factual content
- Learn with simpler format first
- Skills transfer to other platforms later
- One platform at a time = actually finish things

**The Plan:**
1. IG Carousel (nearly done - just design finishing touches)
2. Auto-publishing to IG (next step)
3. YouTube video automation (after IG works)
4. TikTok (after YouTube)
5. Analytics infrastructure (~1 week or more from now)

**Outcome:** ⏳ *~95% done on carousel generation, auto-publish next*
**Timeline:** 18 days to get carousel solid
**Would We Do It Again?** ⏳ *Ask after first month of posting*

---

### Decision: Perfectionism vs Speed
**Date:** Ongoing dilemma
**Context:** Launch now (imperfect) or wait (better)?
**Alternatives:**
- Ship fast, iterate (Silicon Valley way)
- Perfect it first (craftsman way)

**Reasoning:**
- Quality matters for brand reputation
- Rather slow start than bad reputation
- Automation requires upfront time anyway
- Debugging can't be rushed
- Each platform gets faster (learning compounds)

**Outcome:** ⏳ *Carousel took ~18 days but it's solid*
**Trade-off:** Slower to market, but better foundation
**Would We Do It Again?** ⏳ *Probably - depends on revenue results*

### Decision: [Next major decision goes here]
*To be added when it happens...*

## Decision Framework

When facing a fork in the road, we ask:

1. **Does this align with our strengths?** (Perfectionism, technical skills)
2. **Does this build foundation or just short-term gain?**
3. **What do we learn from this path?**
4. **Can we pivot if it's wrong?**
5. **What's the cost of being wrong?**
6. **What does our gut say?**

---

## Patterns We're Noticing

**Build vs Buy:**
- We prefer build (learning > speed for now)
- Exception: tools that save massive time

**Speed vs Quality:**
- We choose quality (our personality won't let us do otherwise)
- Knowing this helps us plan realistically

**Automation vs Manual:**
- We choose automation even when it takes longer upfront
- Pays off on second platform (YouTube will be faster)

**Revenue Timing:**
- We chose infrastructure first
- This could be wrong - we'll see

---

## Open Questions

Questions we don't have answers to yet:

1. **Should we have launched sooner?** *(We'll know in 6 months)*
2. **Is perfectionism helping or hurting?** *(Data will tell)*
3. **Should we hire help or stay solo?** *(TBD based on burnout)*
4. **When's the right time to monetize?** *(After platform 2? 3?)*
5. **Can we actually make this profitable?** *(The big question)*
