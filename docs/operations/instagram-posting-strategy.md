# Instagram Posting Strategy for FactsMind

**Strategic Planning for Global Educational Content**

This is a vital strategic decision. Considering that your content is in **ENGLISH** and high quality (Educational Carousels), your strategy is not the same as a local influencer's.

Here's the winning strategy for a global Facts/Science account:

## 1. Frequency: Less is More (at the beginning) 📉

Since you're posting Carousels, Instagram's algorithm works differently than with Reels.

### The "Re-Serve" Effect

If a user sees the first card of your carousel and doesn't swipe, Instagram often re-shows them the post the next day displaying the second card.

### The Risk

If you post too often (e.g., 3 times per day), you **cannibalize** your own content. The new post "kills" the reach of the previous one before it has had time to circulate.

### My Recommendation

**Startup Phase (Months 1-2):** 1 Post per day. (Consistency is key).

**Growth Phase:** If you have plenty of stock and see high engagement, you can increase to 2 per day (one in the morning, one at night), but never more than that.

## 2. Best Times (Thinking Globally) 🌍

Although you're in Spain (CET timezone), your English content has its largest potential audience in the USA, UK, and Northern Europe.

You need to post when Americans are waking up/having lunch and Europeans are leaving work.

### The Magic Time (Spanish Time): ⏰ 18:00h - 20:00h

**Why?**

- **Spain/Europe:** People are leaving work or on the couch (18h-20h).
- **New York (EST):** It's lunchtime (12h-14h). Peak scrolling moment.
- **California (PST):** It's morning (9h-11h). Work/coffee time.

### Secondary Time (If doing 2 posts per day): ⏰ 12:00h - 13:30h

Works well for Europe (lunch) and catches early risers on the US East Coast (6am-7am).

## 3. The Ideal Routine for "FactsMind"

Since you have it automated with n8n, precision is effortless. Program the system for this routine:

### Monday to Friday: 18:30h (Spain Time)

This is the moment of maximum accumulated global audience.

### Weekends

People connect later. You can try 19:30h or 20:00h.

## 💡 Pro Tip for the Algorithm

**Don't post and leave.** The algorithm rewards immediate interaction.

1. **Right after posting** (or when you get the n8n notification), access the account.
2. **Share the post to your Stories** with a Sticker (like "Tap Here" or a poll related to the topic).
3. **If someone comments in the first 30 minutes**, respond quickly. This boosts visibility.

## Summary

**Start with 1 daily post at 18:30h.** It's safe, sustainable, and targets the main markets.

## Implementation with n8n

### Automated Scheduling

Configure your n8n workflow to trigger at:

- **Primary slot:** 18:30h CET (Monday-Friday)
- **Weekend slot:** 19:30h CET (Saturday-Sunday)

### Post-Publication Actions

Set up notifications so you can:
1. Share to Stories within 5 minutes
2. Monitor comments in the first 30 minutes
3. Engage with early interactions

### Timezone Reference

| Location | Time when posting at 18:30h CET |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Spain (CET) | 18:30 |
| UK (GMT) | 17:30 |
| New York (EST) | 12:30 |
| Los Angeles (PST) | 09:30 |
| Sydney (AEDT) | 04:30 (next day) |

## Metrics to Track

Monitor these KPIs to validate the strategy:

- **Reach per post** (should increase over time)
- **Carousel swipe-through rate** (% who see all 4 slides)
- **Engagement rate** (likes + comments + shares / reach)
- **Follower growth rate** (weekly)
- **Re-serve effectiveness** (Instagram Insights → "From Home/Profile")

## Adjustment Triggers

Consider adjusting the strategy if:

- **High engagement but low reach:** Try posting at 12:00h instead
- **Low swipe-through rate:** Review carousel hooks and visual quality
- **Audience primarily from one timezone:** Shift posting time accordingly
- **Ready to scale:** Add second daily post at 12:00h after 2 months of consistent posting
